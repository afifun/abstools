== Functions

Functions in ABS define names for parametrized data expressions. A Function in ABS is always side effect-free, which means that it cannot manipulate the heap.

.Syntax

[source]
----
def Int length(IntList list) =
case list {
	Nil => 0;
	Cons(n, ls) => 1 + length(ls);
};

.Parametric Functions

Parametric Functions allow to work with parametric data types in a general way. For exam-
ple, given a list of any type, a parametric function head can return the first element, regardless
of its type. Parametric functions are defined like normal functions but have an additional type
parameter section inside angle brackets (< >) after the function name.

.Syntax

----
def A head<A>(List<A> list) =
	case list {
	Cons(x, xs) => x;
};

----
(Note that head is a partial function.)
