== Names and Types

.Names
A name in ABS can either be a simple identifier as described above, or can be qualified with a type name, which represents a module. Examples for syntactically valid names are: head, x, ABS.StdLib.tail. Examples for type names are: Unit, X, ABS.StdLib.Map.

.Types
Types in ABS are either plain type names or can have type arguments. A type name can refer to a data type, an interface, a type synonym, and a type parameter. Note that classes cannot be used as types in ABS. In addition, only parametric data types can have type arguments. Examples for syntactically valid types are: Bool, ABS.StdLib.Int, List<Bool>, ABS.StdLib.Map<Int,Bool>.

.Type Synonyms
Type Synonyms define synonyms for otherwise defined types. Type synonyms start with an uppercase letter.
